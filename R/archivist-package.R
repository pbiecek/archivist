#' @description
#' Data exploration and modelling is a process in which a lot of data artifacts are produced. 
#' Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots, statistical models, different  versions of data sets and different versions of results. 
#' The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced and the harder it is to manage these artifacts. 
#' 
#' Archivist helps to store and manage artifacts created in R.
#' 
#' Archivist allows you to store selected artifacts as binary files
#'   together with their metadata and relations.
#' Archivist allows you to share artifacts with others, either through a shared folder or github.
#' Archivist allows you to look for already created artifacts by using its class, 
#'  name, date of creation or other properties.
#' It also facilitates restoring such artifacts.
#' Archivist allows to check if a new artifact is the exact 
#'  copy of the one that was produced some time ago.
#'  This might be useful either for testing or caching.
