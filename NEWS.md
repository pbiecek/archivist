archivist 1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* **Archivist Integration With GitHub API:** new functions:
	1. it is possible to create new GitHub repository with an empty `archivist`-like `Repository` with `createEmptyGithubRepo` function. We also added `createEmptyLocalRepo` to maintain consistency with other sister functions. `createEmptyRepo` is now a wrapper around `createEmptyLocalRepo` and `createEmptyGithubRepo` functions.
	2. Added manual page to enable easier usage of this integration: ``?`archivist-github-integration```. 
* **Bugs fixed:**
	1. `checkDirectory` function is now immune to directories that don't exist. This made
`showLocalRepo` function working properly when passed an argument to the directory
that do not exist.
	2. Changed `dbDisconnect( conn )` call to the `on.exit(dbDisconnect( conn ))` in `executeSingleQuery` function to prevent a situation in which during an error inside a function (which might be produced), the connection stays open, when it shouldn`t.
	3. `%a%` operator does react on `default = TRUE` in `createEmpyRepo` function.
  4. `deleteRoot = TRUE` argument of the `deleteRepo` function works properly and enables
  removing root directory of the Repository.
  5. Some changes in `rmFromRepo`'s body:
    1. Function will give an error when a user uses a wrong md5hash (that does not exist in the `Repository`)
    2. Artifacts' data is now removed from tag table in `backpack.db` file when `many = TRUE`.
    3. Artifacts' data files are now removed from `gallery` folder when `many = TRUE`.
    4. Artifact's (Artifacts') data files are now removed from `gallery` folder when `many = FALSE`.
    5. `Invisible(NULL)` is the result of the function evaluation.
  6. Some changes in `copy*Repo`'s body:
    1. `Invisible(NULL)` is the result of the function evaluation
  7. Some changes in `zipGithubRepo`'s body:
    1. New order of expressions: `createEmptyRepo(...)` before `tempRepoTo <- ...`
    2. `paste0()` function was replaced by `file.path()` function in appropriate places.
  8. `copyFromLocalRepo` and `copyFromGithubRepo` copies only distinct records for table `tag` and `artifact` in `backpack.db` file, that can be seen with `show*Repo` and copies all mentioned artifacts for local version.
* **New features:**
	1. `print.ahistory` function can now print outputs of the artifact's history as the `knitr::kable` would.
	2. Examples for `searchInGithubRepo` now works for `user='pbiecek'` and `repo='archivist` parameters as we added new backpack.db file. The previous one was almost empty (for 7 months).
	3. Additional examples to better understand usage of archivist package functions:
		1. in `loadFromRepo` function - Loading artifacts from the repository which is built in the archivist package and saving them on the example repository.
		2. in `createEmptyRepo` function - creating a default local Repository in non existing directory.
		3. in `rmFromRepo` function - removing artifacts with `many = TRUE` argument
		4. in `deleteRepo` function - using `deleteRoot = TRUE` argument 
    5. in `copy*Repo` function - using copyLocalRepo function
  4. Alterations in the text of: `?Tags`, `?Repository`, `?md5hash`, `archivist-package`, 
  `?saveToRepo`, `loadFromRepo`, `summaryRepo`, `showRepo`, `?searchInRepo`, `?createEmptyRepo`,
  `?rmFromRepo`, `?deleteRepo`, `copyToRepo`, `zipRepo` documentation pages.
	5. Adding missing functions which are used in the archivist package now to `?Repository` documentation page.

archivist 1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* The order of parameters in asearch has changed!
* Added graphGallery for self-contained examples
* aread allows for single MD5 hash (which will be read from the default repo)
* asearch allows for only patterns (will be searched in local repo)
* ahistory has now 'artifact' argument instead of 'obj'

* Added tests.
* Removed unnecessary dependencies - now archivist is free of dependencies.
* shiny package is in Suggests so you
should load that package before running shinySearchInLocalRepo function.
* Moved `saveSetToRepo` with a new function `loadSetFromRepo` to the `github.com/pbiecek/archivist2` repository.

archivist 1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* Fix in aread(), now subdirectories are handled properly
* aoption() handles default values for archivist parameters
* createEmptyRepo() takes 'default' argument. If set to TRUE, then the new empty repo becomes the default one.
* Added CITATION
* Added new demo, as for JSS article replication script
