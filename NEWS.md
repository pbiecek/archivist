archivist 2.3.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
* (dirty) fix for TCL protocol in SSL for git on Windows ([#380](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/issues/380)). 

archivist 2.3.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Missing parameter in `asearchLocal()`. Now `repo` is passed correctly to `loadFromLocalRepo` ([#333](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/333)). 

archivist 2.3.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
* The `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` is closed, this is why we need to update hooks to `https://raw.githack.com` ([#332](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/332)). 

archivist 2.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Internal changes in the `cache()` function due to  ([#327](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/327)). Effect of the bytecompiler needs further research.

archivist 2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Examples are changed to comply with CRAN Policy  ([#324](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/324)).
* `saveToLocalRepo()` and `saveToRepo()` have now additional parameter `use_flocks`. If set up to `TRUE` then `flock` package is use to synchronize access to database ([#322](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/322)).

archivist 2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Two new functions `asearchLocal()` and `areadLocal()` that work as `asearch()` and `aread()` for selected local repositories ([#298](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/298)).
* parameter `force` has now different meaning in `createLocalRepo()`. As suggested in ([#319](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/319)) and ([#318](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/318)) if forces to override existing backpack.db file.
* Updated CITATION
* New function `adigest()` allows to use different hash functions ([#323](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/323))
* New cheatsheet for archivist https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/tree/master/cheatsheets ([#320](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/320)).

archivist 2.1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
* `dbExecute()` is used instead of `dbGetQuery()` as is recommended in latest version of `DBI` package ([#316](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/316)).
* Function `removeTagsRepo()` is added. It allows to remove specific tags from specific objects. Note that you cannot specify tags via regular expressions (to avoid some accidental deletes). You can always use `getLocalTags()` to get list of available tags.
* More databases can be used to keep artifacts metadata (previously only SQLite was supported). Find more examples and descriptions in `createPostgresRepo()` and `setPostgresRepo()`. Note, that it's still an experimental feature.
* Updated CITATION

archivist 2.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
* It is possible to archive tags specified by a user without defualt tags [[#309](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/309)]

archivist 2.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
* GG-plots in the package's repository are now created with ggplot2 v2.2
* Replication script is updated to be consistent with new ggplots

archivist 2.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **Bugs fixed:**
 1. Fixed bug: All examples fail when CreateLocalRepo is invoked with the `default=FALSE` parameter. [[#291](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/291)]
 2. Changed `aread` and `asearch` examples due to new version of ggplot2 - 2.2.0 [[#296](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/296)]
 3. Changed `asave` examples due to new version of ggplot2 - 2.2.0 [[#300](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/300)]


archivist 2.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **New features**:
  1. `aread()`, `asearch()`, `searchInLocalRepo()` and `loadFromLocalRepo()` are now handling URL addresses as well. This may be useful to access artifacts generated by the shiny app.
  2. `%a%` archives proper names of first object so does `ahistory` prints proper name of archived artifact instead of `env[[nm]]`. [[#269](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/269)]
  3. `addHooksToPrint()` :
    1. Can now give links in `latex` format as it has new `format` argument. [[#270](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/270)]
    2. Archives artifacts with their original names instead md5hashes. [[#287](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/287)]
* **New functions**:
    1. The `atrace()` function is added. It call `trace()` function to store a selected object in the repository after each call to specified FUN (for example 'lm').


archivist 2.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **New features**:
  1. `restoreLibs()` can now restore libraries in custom directory. [[#251](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/251#issuecomment-189891833)
  2. `createMDGallery` has new `maxTags` parameter so that gallery's summaries in the `README.md` files now has limited chunk's length. [[#249](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/249)]
  3. We've added section 'Notes' to each man page with the link to [https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues)


archivist 2.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

* **New functions**:
    1. The `restoreLibs()` function is added. It recovers previous versions of R packages. Needed due to rapid changes in structure of `ggplot2` objects. Now one can restore version of the `ggplot2` package consistent with archived object.


archivist 2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

* **New functions**:
    1. All *Github* functions are now *Remote* functions. This is because we support more than just GitHub repos (currently github + git/hg bitbucket)
    2. `RemoteRepoCheck` is used to verify if parameters for remote repo are correct.
    3. `asession` returns session info for given artifact (similar to aread).
    4. `aformat` returns vector of formats in which the artifact is saved (similar to aread).
* **New features**:
    1. `saveToRepo` by default saves session info.
    2. `repoDirGit` has changed name to `subdir` and the default value is now '/'.
    3. All remote functions support github and bitbucket (see the `repoType` parameter).
    4. `alink` is now working with github and bitbucket repositories.
    5. `asearch` returns named list of artifacts. MD5hashes are used as names.
    6. `silent=TRUE` by default in `saveToRepo`. Less warnings.
    7. `saveToRepo` has now two copies, consistent with other names `saveToLocalRepo` an short one `asave`.
* **Deprecations and new naming convention**:
    1. `archive`, `cloneGitHubRepo`, `createGitHubRepo`, (`deleteGithubRepo`) `deleteGitHubRepo`, (`pushRepo`) `pushGitHubRepo`, (`pullRepo`) `pullGitHubRepo` have been moved to separate [`archivist.github`](https://github.com/MarcinKosinski/archivist.github) package to maintain Local/Remote consistency. [[#198](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/198)].
      1. For the above reason `deleteRepo` was deprecated. Use `deleteLocalRepo`
      2. For the above reason `createEmptyLocalRepo` and `createEmptyRepo` were deprecated. Use `createLocalRepo`.
      3. For the above reason `rmFromRepo` was deprecated. Use `rmFromLocalRepo`
    2. `multiSearchInLocalRepo` and it's remote version were deprecated. Now multiple patterns are available in `searchInLocalRepo`/`searchInRemoteRepo`. 
    
archivist 1.9
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **New functions**:
    1. `alink` function: Returns a Link To Download an Artifact Stored on GitHub Repository. Ideal combination with `archive`
    2. `pushRepo` function which add files, commits them and pushes from Local `Repository` to synchronized GitHub one. [[#146](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/146)].
    3. `pullRepo` pulls (`git pull`) changes from remote GitHub `Repository` to the corresponding Local one. [[#146](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/146)].
    4. New functions `deleteLocalRepo` (previous `deleteRepo`) and `deleteGithubRepo`.  [[#156](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/156)].
    5. `createGithubMDGallery` that give the markdown summary for each artifact in the repository. Ideal for README.md file. Example [[#144](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/144#issuecomment-174192366)]
* **Bugs fixed**:
    1. `asearch` function enables a user to read artifacts from default GitHub repository. In the previous version it was possible only in default local repository.
    2. It is now possible to unset global Repository with `apotions('repo/repoDir', NULL, unset = TRUE)` [[#176](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/176)].
* **New features**:
    1. Alterations in the text of: `?ahistory`, `?cache`, `?asearch`, `?archive`, `?cloneGithubRepo`, `githubFunctions`, `?shinySearchInLocalRepo`, `?alink` documentation pages.
    2. Additional examples to better understand usage of archivist package functions: 
        1. In `asearch` completely new example section divided into 3 subsections: default local repository, default GitHub resository and Github repository.
    3. Added new tags in the following methods: `extractTags.lm`, `extractTags.htest`. `extractTags.lda`, `extractTags.qda`, `extractTags.survfit`, `extractTags.glmnet`, `extractTags.partition`.
    4. `htest` object's data is now saved to repository as a list.
    5. It is possible to archive `devtoolss::session_info()` with an artifact during the execution of `saveToRepo()` and `archive()` [[#184](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/184)].
    6. New tag `format:` is now added to every artifact/miniature. Artifacts can be saved in different (and more than one) formats (rda/json/csv) what makes them easier to access from other languages.

* **New and renamed parameters**:
    1. `user.name` and `user.password` parameters of `archive` and `createEmptyGithubRepo` were changed into `user` and `password` correspondingly.
    2. `createEmptyGithubRepo` now can use `repoDir` to specify in which directory the synchronized Local Repository should be created [[#142](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/142)]. 
    3. `archive` no longer cats hook to the artifact during the execution. Hook cat can be set with new `alink` parameter that uses `alink()` function, where parameters can be passed with `...`.
    4. `deleteRepo` has now new `unset` parameter that allows to unset global `aoptions('repoDir', NULL, unset = TRUE)` when deleted `repoDir` was a globally specified Repository [[#157](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/157)].
    5. Changed parameter name in `cloneGithubRepo` from `local_path` to `repoDir` to maintain consistency within package documentation and name convention.
    6. `createEmptyGithubRepo`, `createEmptyRepo(type ='github')` and `cloneGithubRepo` now reacts on new `default` parameter which sets newly created/cloned repositories (GitHub and synchronized with it Local one) as default [[#171](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/171) , [#142](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/142)].
    7. Changed the name of `chain` parameter to `value` in `saveToRepo` function [#101](https://github.com/pbiecek/archivist/issues/101)].
    8. Changed the name of `aformat` parameter to `format` in `ahistory()` to maintain consistency with `alink()` function.
    9. Fix in `alink`. Now the `repoDirGit` is supported.

archivist 1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* **Archivist Integration With GitHub API:** new functions:
	  1. It is possible to create new GitHub repository with an empty `archivist`-like `Repository` with `createEmptyGithubRepo` function. We also added `createEmptyLocalRepo` to maintain consistency with other sister functions. `createEmptyRepo` is now a wrapper around `createEmptyLocalRepo` and `createEmptyGithubRepo` functions.
	  2. One can now clone GitHub-archivist repo with new `cloneGithubRepo` function.
  	3. One can automatically archive artifacts to Local and synchronized GitHub archivist-like Repositories with new `archive` function. Example: https://github.com/MarcinKosinski/archive-test4/commits/master
  	4. Added manual page to enable easier usage of this integration: ``?`archivist-github-integration``` (or shorter `?agithub`).
* **New functions:** 
	  1. `splitTagsLocal` and `splitTagsGithub` enabling to split `tag` column in database into two separate columns: `tagKey` and `tagValue`.
* **Bugs fixed:**
	  1. `checkDirectory` function is now immune to directories that don't exist. This made
`showLocalRepo` function working properly when passed an argument to the directory
that do not exist.
	  2. Changed `dbDisconnect( conn )` call to the `on.exit(dbDisconnect( conn ))` in `executeSingleQuery` function to prevent a situation in which during an error inside a function (which might be produced), the connection stays open, when it shouldn`t.
	  3. `%a%` operator does react on `default = TRUE` in `createEmptyRepo` function.
    4. `deleteRoot = TRUE` argument of the `deleteRepo` function works properly and enables removing root directory of the Repository.
    5. Some changes in `rmFromRepo`'s body:
        1. Function will give a warning when a user uses wrong md5hash (that does not exist in the `Repository`).
    In case of wrong md5hash abbreviation a user will receive an error message.
        2. Artifacts' data is now removed from tag table in `backpack.db` file when
    `many = TRUE`. They were not removed before.
        3. Artifacts' data files are now removed from `gallery` folder.
    They were not removed before.
        4. `Invisible(NULL)` is the result of the function evaluation.
    6. Some changes in `copy*Repo`'s body:
        1. `Invisible(NULL)` is the result of the function evaluation
        2. `repoFrom` parameter in `copyLocalRepo` is set to `NULL` as default.
    7. `copyFromLocalRepo` and `copyFromGithubRepo` copies only distinct records for table `tag` and `artifact` in `backpack.db` file, that can be seen with `show*Repo` and copies all mentioned artifacts for local version.
    8. `downloadDB` in `createEmptyRepo` function gives a user-friendly error.
    9. In `zipGithubRepo` unzipped file has the same name as zip file. Earlier it had a name of the temporary file that was difficult to notice.
    10. In `setGithubRepo` it is now possible to use repoDirGit parameter. Before there was wrong `stopifnot` condition.
    11. `paste0()` was replaced by `file.path()` in appropriate places of function's bodies in the following R scripts: `archive.R`, `copyToRepo.R`, `createEmptyRepo.R`, `deleteRepo.R`,
`extractMiniature.R`, `loadFromRepo.R`, `rmFromRepo.R`, `saveToRepo.R`, `zipRepo.R`.
    12. Two crucial parts of `checkDirectory`'s function body were removed due to changes in point 11.
`checkDirectory2` was completely removed as it is unnecessary now.
    13. Small change in `test_base_functionalities.R` due to changes in point 11 and 12.
    14. `aoptions` for `user` and `repo` will work properly with `showGithubRepo` and `summaryGithubRepo` when set. It might have not been noticed in version 1.7, it might have been a bug that occured in the development between 1.7 and 1.8 version.
* **New features:**
	  1. `print.ahistory` function can now print outputs of the artifact's history as the `knitr::kable` would.
	  2. Examples for `searchInGithubRepo` now works for `user='pbiecek'` and `repo='archivist` parameters as we added new backpack.db file. The previous one was almost empty (for 7 months).
	  3. Additional examples to better understand usage of archivist package functions:
        1. in `loadFromRepo` function - Loading artifacts from the repository which is built in the archivist package and saving them on the example repository.
        2. in `createEmptyRepo` function - creating a default local Repository in non existing directory.
        3. in `rmFromRepo` function - removing artifacts with `many = TRUE` argument.
        4. in `deleteRepo` function - using `deleteRoot = TRUE` argument. 
        5. in `copy*Repo` function - using graphGallery local repository in `copyLocalRepo` function.
        6. in `get*Tags` function - additional example using `getTagsLocal` function.
        7. in `aoptions` function - added two new examples concerning usage of `silent` and `repoDir` parameters in this function.
	  4. Alterations in the text of: `?Tags`, `?Repository`, `?md5hash`, `archivist-package`, `?saveToRepo`, `loadFromRepo`, `summaryRepo`, `showRepo`, `?searchInRepo`, `?createEmptyRepo`, `?rmFromRepo`, `?deleteRepo`, `copyToRepo`, `zipRepo`, `setRepo`, `getTags`, `addTagsRepo`, `magrittr`, `archivistOptions`, `?aread` documentation pages.
	  5. Adding missing functions which are used in the archivist package now to `?Repository` documentation page.
	  6. `tempdir()` was replaced by `tempfile()` in examples sections of: `?addTagsRepo`, `?cache`, `copyToRepo`, `createEmptyRepo`, `?deleteRepo`, `loadFromRepo`, `?rmFromRepo`, `?saveToRepo`, `setRepo`, `showRepo`, `summaryRepo`, `?Tags`, `zipRepo` documentation pages. `tempdir` is existing  directory in which R works so calling `deleteRepo( exampleRepoDir, deleteRoot=TRUE)` removed important R files.
	  7. New tests for the following functions: `zip*Repo`.
    8. In order to obtain cohesion with `Tags` in all functions there has been stated
such an order:
        1. If we use `Tags` in the text of function's documentation, examples' comments, then `Tags` are considered as a proper name and they begin with capital letter.
        2. If we use `tags` in function's body, as parameters, as R object's atrributes, then they begin with small letter.
    9. Added checking if parameters have appropriate lengths in the following function's bodies:
`?addTagsRepo`, `asearch`, `?cloneGithubRepo`, `copy*Repo`, `createEmptyLocalRepo`, `getTags*`, `loadFrom*Repo`, `?rmFromRepo`, `?saveToRepo`, `searchIn*Repo`, `set*Repo`, `?shinySearchInLocalRepo`, `showRepo`, `summary*Repo`, `zip*Repo`
    
archivist 1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* The order of parameters in asearch has changed!
* Added graphGallery for self-contained examples
* aread allows for single MD5 hash (which will be read from the default repo)
* asearch allows for only patterns (will be searched in local repo)
* ahistory has now 'artifact' argument instead of 'obj'

* Added tests.
* Removed unnecessary dependencies - now archivist is free of dependencies.
* shiny package is in Suggests so you
should load that package before running shinySearchInLocalRepo function.
* Moved `saveSetToRepo` with a new function `loadSetFromRepo` to the `github.com/pbiecek/archivist2` repository.

archivist 1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* Fix in aread(), now subdirectories are handled properly
* aoption() handles default values for archivist parameters
* createEmptyRepo() takes 'default' argument. If set to TRUE, then the new empty repo becomes the default one.
* Added CITATION
* Added new demo, as for JSS article replication script

	...should be updated...

archivist 1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	...should be updated...

archivist 1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
* Added `setLocalRepo` and `setGithubRepo` functions.
